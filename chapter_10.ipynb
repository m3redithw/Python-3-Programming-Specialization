For example, the file myPythonProgram.py could contain the code open('../myData/data2.txt', 'r'). The ../ means to go up one level in the directory structure, to the containing folder (allProjects); myData/ says to descend into the myData subfolder.\n",

You can tell an absolute file path because it begins with a /. If you will ever move your programs and data to another computer (e.g., to share them with someone else), it will be much more convenient if your use relative file paths rather than absolute. "
