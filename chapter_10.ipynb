    "\n",
    "If your file and your Python program are in different directories, however, then you need to specify a path. You can think of the filename as the short name for a file, and the path as the full name. Typically, you will specify a relative file path, which says where to find the file to open, relative to the directory where the code is running from. For example, the file myPythonProgram.py could contain the code open('../myData/data2.txt', 'r'). The ../ means to go up one level in the directory structure, to the containing folder (allProjects); myData/ says to descend into the myData subfolder.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an option to use an absolute file path. For example, suppose the file structure in the figure is stored on a computer in the userâ€™s home directory, /Users/joebob01/myFiles. Then code in any Python program running from any file folder could open data2.txt via open('/Users/joebob01/myFiles/allProjects/myData/data2.txt', 'r'). You can tell an absolute file path because it begins with a /. If you will ever move your programs and data to another computer (e.g., to share them with someone else), it will be much more convenient if your use relative file paths rather than absolute. "
